# Email-and-Titanic-Data-Classification
This project seeks to experiment KNN and Naive Bayes Classification models to 1)Predict the chance of an email being spam or not using Naive Bayes Classifier and 2)predict the survivals and deaths of the Titanic using KNN.

# Motivation
This project was done as part of a Data Science Course to observe the performance of two classifiers(KNN and Naive Bayes)
